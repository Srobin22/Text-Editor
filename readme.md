# Text Editor 
## Description
A simple text editor developed in assembly. 
Use the navigator keys to naviagate around the typed texts on the text editor.
Use the ESC button to quit. 
You can save your text file by pressing ctrl+s. The information is saved on FILE.TXT file.
Enter,Backspace,Space,Delete works as expected.
##Bugs
The tab button doesn't fully work as intended. Rather than tab it works as 8 spaces.
##Installation
This program can be compiled and run using MASM assembler. I have used emu8086 emulator to run it.
